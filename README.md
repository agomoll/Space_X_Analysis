# Space_X_Analysis


## Overview
In recent years private and public companies have launched into the extra-terrestrial products and travel market creating a commercial space age. For example, Virgin Galactic has offered some space flights, Rocket Labs provides small satellites, and Blue Origin manufactures reusable rockets. In the same vein, Space X has sent spacecraft to the international space station as well as other manned missions to space. Space X has been able to execute more launches than other providers as their signature rockets are reusable, allowing for relatively inexpensive missions. Advertised at $62 million per launch, the Space X missions undercut competing providers with more expensive lauches at $162 million. 

This analysis aims to more accurately predict the price of each launch using data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning to predict the reusability of Space X rockets.
